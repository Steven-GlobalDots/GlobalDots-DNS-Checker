# This project contains a Cloudflare Worker in the /backend directory
# The frontend should be deployed via Cloudflare Pages, NOT as a Worker

# To prevent Cloudflare Pages from auto-detecting this as a Worker project,
# you MUST manually configure the build settings in the Cloudflare Dashboard:

# 1. Go to: Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Your Project → Settings → Builds & deployments
# 2. Set the following:
#    - Framework preset: None
#    - Build command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
#    - Build output directory: frontend/dist
#    - Root directory: (leave empty or set to /)

# The backend worker must be deployed separately:
# cd backend && npx wrangler deploy
